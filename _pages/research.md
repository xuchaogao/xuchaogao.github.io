The impacts of population mobility controls on housing prices: Evidence from the 2014
household registration reform in China (Job Market Paper)

Household registration system (Hukou system) as a mobility control instrument in China largely restricts individualsâ€™ access to social welfare system out of their hometown, making it costly and inconvenient for migrants to live in the hosting cities in the long term. Majority of the migrants do not consider purchase houses where they work without a Hukou. In this paper, I study the effects of 2014 Hukou reform, a major household registration relaxation, on housing prices in the urban area. Using apartment complex level housing data, I find that the implementation of the reform lead to an increase in prices of lower-quality residential properties while those of higher quality experience negative shocks. This is consistent with the findings in previous literature that more migrant workers move to places where controls are relaxed, which spur demands for basic housing. I further supplement the findings and investigate potential mechanisms using household survey data.
