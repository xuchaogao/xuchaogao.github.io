<b> The impacts of population mobility controls on housing prices: Evidence from the 2014
household registration reform in China </b>  (Job Market Paper) Draft Coming soon.

Household registration system (Hukou system) as a mobility control instrument in China largely restricts individualsâ€™ access to social welfare system out of their hometown, making it costly and inconvenient for migrants to live in the hosting cities in the long term. Majority of the migrants do not consider purchase houses where they work without a Hukou. In this paper, I study the effects of 2014 Hukou reform, a major household registration relaxation, on housing prices in the urban area. Using apartment complex level housing data, I find that the implementation of the reform lead to an increase in prices of lower-quality residential properties while those of higher quality experience negative shocks. This is consistent with the findings in previous literature that more migrant workers move to places where controls are relaxed, which spur demands for basic housing. I further supplement the findings and investigate potential mechanisms using household survey data.

<b> Network job and worker benefits of rural urban migrants in China. </b> Draft Coming soon.

Despite the rise in the number of rural urban migrants since the 1980s, many migrants remain unaware of or are denied their entitled labor benefits. This situation could be exacerbated by the lack of transparency about worker benefits, and the high mobility of the migrant workforce. Using Chinese rural urban migration data, this paper studies whether jobs obtained through social network provide better worker benefits. My results suggest that network jobs tend to be associated with worse benefits. I discuss a few potential reasons behind this pattern. Furthermore, I find that migrants' decision to stay in urban areas is influenced more by housing benefits than other forms of worker benefits.
